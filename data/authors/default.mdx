Hey there! I'm Nam, a final-year Data Science student at HCMUSâ€”just a random guy on my way to becoming a Data Engineer.

This blog is where I document my journey of self-improvement, learning, and growth. 

I share my experiences, insights, and everything I find interesting along the way.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to reach out if anything catches your interest.
